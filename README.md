# Password Changer
A web-based (Python / Flask) password changer utility. Allows a user (authenticated via their Google account) to change their account password. The backend can be modified to change passwords for other accounts at the same time, thus allowing for passwords to be kept in sync with the Google account.

Written in Python using the Flask framework. Includes install script for a Windows setup.
